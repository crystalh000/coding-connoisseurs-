## Brief Overview

A poor diet and lack of nutrition can lead to detrimental effects on one's health in both the short and long term. It can be difficult to constantly keep track of and consume the right amount of nutrients, especially since human bodies can sometimes take longer to respond negatively to a poor diet. The best defense is to maintain a healthy diet with a balance of nutrients, but this approach demands a lot of time and effort with all the nutrients and foods consumed by the average person every day.

Our app attempts to ease the amount of labor involved in the process by only requiring the user to photograph their meals through the app. Then we use AI photo analysis to extract and record nutritional information from each meal, and run a data analysis algorithms to provide feedback on their nutritional intake after set time intervals. Users will also be able to manually input nutritional and personal information or goals to further improve the accuracy of recommendations.

## User side

Users begin by creating an account and inputting information about themselves. Then we will introduce the app throguh a tutorial, including how to use its features and what to do every day.

Every day, the user will use the app to photograph their food and/or drinks before eating. The app will display data to confirm that the AI got it right, then records the information to the user's account data.

Every week, the user will receive a notification containing their weekly summary of nutrtitional intake and how well they did compared to the healthy ranges for their demographic. The app will give suggestions for what foods to try and eat more of to make up nutritional deficiencies, or recommend cutbacks for foods that contain too much of a category. The summary would also contain information on progress toward goals, if the user has set any.

## If we had more time

We would like to expand the app to cover more aspects of health, such as movement/activity data, and help users better track their other habits alongside their nutritianal data. This would help them maintain awareness about their lifestyle's healthiness and lets the app provide recommendations for how to reach their goals.

We would also add options to share pictures that they took or share some statistics. We might also add a particularly healthy meal to the weekly summary.

We would also recommend places where the user could go to get food that makes up deficiencies, or alternatives that cut back on surpluses. This could be done by searching local restaurants and recommending a range of nearby places where the user could go.
