## Brief Overview

A poor diet and lack of nutrition can lead to detrimental effects on one's health in both the short and long term. It can be difficult to constantly keep track of and consume the right amount of nutrients, especially since human bodies can sometimes take longer to respond negatively to a poor diet. The best defense is to maintain a healthy diet with a balance of nutrients, but this approach demands a lot of time and effort with all the nutrients and foods consumed by the average person every day.

Our app attempts to ease the amount of labor involved in the process by only requiring the user to photograph their meals through the app. Then we use AI photo analysis to extract and record nutritional information from each meal, and run a data analysis algorithms to provide feedback on their nutritional intake after set time intervals. Users will also be able to manually input nutritional information and input information about themselves to further improve the accuracy of recommendations.
